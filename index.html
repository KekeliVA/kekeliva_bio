    <p>I am from the line of kings of Gondor that has broken. I turned my back on my birthright for the life of a ranger. 
       One day I met a group of hobbits, hunted my a pack of ringwraiths. We journeyed too a council of friends where we 
       chose Frodo to destroy the ring of power. We were to escort them, but our party split due to our enemies Sauron and
       Saruman. I assisted in command for the Battle of Helm's Deep and brought the spirits of former soldiers to uphold their
       oath to the previous King of Gondor. After the battle of Pelennor fields, we marched to Mordor to fight Sauron's army and
       Frodo was successful in destroying the ring of power.
